Mobile crowd sensing has become an emerging computing and sensing paradigm that
recruits ordinary participants to perform sensing tasks. With the highly dynamic mobility
pattern and the abundance of on-board resources, vehicles have been increasingly
recruited to participate large-scale crowd sensing applications such as urban sensing.
However, existing participant recruitment algorithms take a long time in recruitment
decision for large number of vehicular participants. In this paper, a fast algorithm for vehicle
participant recruitment problem is proposed, which achieves linear-time complexity at the
sacrifice of a slightly lower sensing quality. The participant recruitment problem is modeled
as a unconstrained maximization problem without explicitly cost constraint and a trade-off
parameter is introduced to control the recruiter cost. Trace-driven simulations on both realworld and synthetic data-sets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is 50 times faster than
the state-of-art algorithm at the sacrifice of 5% lower sensing quality when the number of
participants is over 1000
